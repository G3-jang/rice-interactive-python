if u instal south , you dont need to do syncdb anymore
--->>python manage.py schemamigration appname --initial

above command creates a initial0001.py file ,which stores the create table and have the intial data
you can do this before you create a django project


else you have to replace the above command to --auto in place of initial
which creates another 0002.py file with the modified class structure

--->>python manage.py migrate appname
checks initial and auto .py file and migrate 


--->> python manage.py convert_to_south appname
if u have already created a db and tables and then u installed south 
then u can use above cmnd first for the paticular app
then proceed with schema migration auto

---> auto creates a .py file in local server inside app

--->migrate appname then do its job in db

---->python manage.py migrate --fake appname

above cmnd is used when you delete a modified 0002 file from db,but you have a copy of 0002.py file inside migration folder, to get that .py from migration to db

other way rnd
if u have 0002 in db but u delete 0002.py file from migration folder den ,delete 0002 from db den do schema migration and do migrate
